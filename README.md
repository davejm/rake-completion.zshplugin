rake-completion.zshplugin
=========================

rake task tab completion plugin for zsh, suitable for use with antigen. I didn't write
it (see http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/3/9/fast-rake-task-completion-for-zsh/), but
I wanted it in a zsh plugin so I could use it now that I've switched to antigen.
